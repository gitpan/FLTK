=head1 NAME

FLTK::xpmImage - Image subclass that draws the data from an xpm format file

=head1 Description

Draws inline XPM data. This is a text-based 256-color image format designed
for X11 and still very useful for making small icons, since the data can be
easily inserted into your source code.

FLTK recognizes a few extensions to the xpm color map:

=over 

=item * Setting the number of colors negative means the second line in the
array is a "compressed" colormap, which is 4 bytes per color of
C<character,r,g,b>.

=item * If all colors are grays and there is no transparent index, it instead
makes a MASK image, where black draws the current color and white is
transparent, and all other grays are partially transparent. This allows you to
put antialiased glyphs into images.
