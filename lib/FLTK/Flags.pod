=head1 NAME

FLTK::Flags - Unified flags set for FLTK

=head1 Description

Type returned by L<C<Widget::flags()>|FLTK::Widget/"flags"> and passed to
L<Box|FLTK::Box> and many other drawing functions.

These flags control the appearance of boxes and widgets. This same value is
used to:

=over 

=item 1. store state and other information in a widget or menu item

=item 2. provide hints to boxes, labeltypes, and images for how to draw

=item 3. provide structural information to an array of menu items

=back 

These are shared because various parts of the code, especially drawing, want
all of this information at once, and providing it as a single word is the
easiest way.
