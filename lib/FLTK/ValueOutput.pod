=head1 NAME

FLTK::ValueOutput - Valuator that displays the number like a text box

=head1 Description

A valuator that displays the number like a text box. This is indended for
showing the user a number, there is no way for the user to change the number.
It is much lighter weight than using an L<FLTK::Output|FLTK::Output> widget
for this.

There is no way for the user to change the number, but calling
L<C<value()>|FLTK::Widget/"value"> will change it.
