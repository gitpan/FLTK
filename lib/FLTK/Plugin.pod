=head1 NAME

FLTK::Plugin - Portable loading of plugins

=head1 Description

This is a wrapper to make it simple to load plugins on various systems.

=head1 Functions

=head2 C<load_plugin>
X<load_plugin>

=over

=item C<my $pointer = $plugin-E<gt>load_plugin( $file, $symbol );>X<my_pointer_plugin_E_gt_load_plugin_file_symbol_>

Will load the C<file> as a plugin and then return a pointer to C<symbol> in
that file.

If C<symbol> is undefined, it will return a non-zero value if the plugin loads
but you cannot use this value for anything.

If there is any problem (file not found, does not load as a plugin, the symbol
is not found) it will return null if there is any problem and print debugging
info on C<STDERR>.
